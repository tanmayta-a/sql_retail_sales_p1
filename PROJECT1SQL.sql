-- My Analysis & Findings

-- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05
	 select * from retail_sales where sale_date='2022-11-05';
     select count(*) from retail_sales where sale_date='2022-11-05';
     
-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 10 in the month of Nov-2022
     --LOGIC-1
	  select * from retail_sales where category ='clothing'
      and sale_date='2022-11-12'
      and quantity>=4;
	  --LOGIC-2
      select * from retail_sales where category ='clothing'
      and TO_CHAR(sale_date,'YYYY-MM')='2022-11'
      and quantity>=4;
	  
-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
	select  category ,
    sum(total_sale) as net_scale,
	count(*) as total_orders
	from retail_sales group by 1;

-- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
    select round(avg(age),2) as avg_age from retail_sales where category='beauty';

-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.
   select count(*) from retail_sales where total_sale>1000;

-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
   select category,gender ,count(*) as total_trans from retail_sales group by category,gender order by 1;

-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
  select year,
  month,
  avg_sale 
  from(
  select extract (year from sale_date)as year,
   extract(month from sale_date)as month,
   avg(total_sale)as avg_sale,
   rank() over(partition by extract (year from sale_date) order by avg(total_sale)desc)

   group by 1,2 
   )as t1
   where rank=1;

-- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
    select
	customer_id, sum(total_sale) as total_sales
	from retail_sales group by 1
	order by 2 desc
	limit 5;

-- Q.9 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.

    select category,count(distinct customer_id)
    as cnt_unique_cd from retail_sales group by 1;



-- Q.10 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders.(Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)


   with hourly_sale
   as
   (
    select *,
    case 
    when extract (hour from sale_time) <12 then 'morning'
    when extract(hour from sale_time) between 12 and 17  then 'afternoon'
    else 'evening'
